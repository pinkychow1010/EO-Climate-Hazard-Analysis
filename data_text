exports.cisi = "📖 Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index\n\
(CISI) represents the global spatial\n\
intensity of CI (transportation,\n\
energy, water, waste, telecommunication,\n\
education, and health). The dataset\n\
is generated from Open Streetmap (2021).\n\
It can be applied to explore the\n\
current landscape of CI, identify CI\n\
hotspots, and as exposure input\n\
for large-scale risk assessments.\n\
