// Description for Datasets

exports.rwi = "📖 Provided by Facebook, the Relative Wealth Index\n\
(RWI) predicts the relative standard of\n\
living within countries using connectivity data\n\
and satellite imagery, via deep learning model.\n\
The RWI has proven useful for identifying pockets\n\
of poverty and potential beneficiaries\n\

exports.cisi = "📖 Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) represents\n\
the global spatial intensity of CI (transportation,\n\
energy, water, waste, telecommunication, education,\n\
and health). The dataset is generated from\n\
Open Streetmap (2021). It can be applied to\n\
explore the current landscape of CI, identify CI\n\
hotspots, and as exposure input for large-scale\n\
risk assessments. 【🖱️ Click heading to view project】";

exports.landscan = "📖 LandScan High-Definition (HD) is the finest resolution\n\
global population distribution data available and \n\
represents an ambient population. It is\n\
intended to aid in emergency preparedness,\n\
recovery missions, risk assessments and site\n\
suitability studies.\n\

data scenario. 【🖱️ Click heading to view project】";

exports.pdsi = "📖 TerraClimate is a dataset of monthly climate\n\
and climatic water balance for global\n\
terrestrial surfaces from 1958-2019. These data\n\
provide important inputs for ecological and \n\
hydrological studies at global scales that require\n\
high spatial resolution and time-varying data. \n\
