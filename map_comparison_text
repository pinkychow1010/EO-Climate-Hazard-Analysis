// Description for Datasets

exports.rwi = "📖 Provided by Facebook, the Relative Wealth Index\n\
(RWI) predicts the relative standard of\n\
living within countries using connectivity data\n\
and satellite imagery, via deep learning model.\n\
The RWI has proven useful for identifying pockets\n\
of poverty and potential beneficiaries\n\

exports.cisi = "📖 Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) represents\n\
the global spatial intensity of CI (transportation,\n\
energy, water, waste, telecommunication, education,\n\
and health). The dataset is generated from\n\
Open Streetmap (2021). It can be applied to\n\
explore the current landscape of CI, identify CI\n\
hotspots, and as exposure input for large-scale\n\
risk assessments. 【🖱️ Click heading to view project】";

exports.landscan = "📖 LandScan High-Definition (HD) is the finest resolution\n\
global population distribution data available and \n\
represents an ambient population. It is\n\
intended to aid in emergency preparedness,\n\
recovery missions, risk assessments and site\n\
suitability studies.\n\

exports.urban = "📖 This urban density layer represents the spatial\n\
density of urban surface detected (% in 5km radius)\n\
from satellite imagery. It is extracted from ESA\n\
WorldCover the first global land cover\n\
products for 2020 and 2021 at 10 m resolution.\n\

exports.cropland = "📖 This cropland density layer represents the\n\
spatial density of agricultural fields detected\n\
(% in 5km radius) from satellite imagery. This\n\
layer is extracted from ESA WorldCover the\n\
first global land cover products for 2020\n\
and 2021 at 10 m resolution.\n\

exports.forest = "📖 This forest density layer represents the\n\
spatial density of forest detected (% in 5km radius) \n\
from satellite imagery. This layer is extracted from ESA WorldCover\n\
the first global land cover products\n\
for 2020 and 2021 at 10 m resolution.\n\

exports.ghsl = "📖 The GHS-SMOD is the rural-urban Settlement\n\
classification model adopted by the GHSL.\n\
The layer values range from 0 (inhabited)\n\
to 3 (high density clusters). It is the\n\
representation of the degree of urbanization\n\
concept into the GHSL data scenario.\n\

exports.pdsi = "📖 This PDSI layer represents relative dryness\n\
from temperature and precipitation data.\n\
It is provided by TerraClimate, a dataset\n\
of monthly climate and climatic water\n\
balance for global terrestrial surfaces\n\
from 1958-2019. These data provide important\n\
inputs for ecological and hydrological studies\n\
at global scales that require high spatial\n\
resolution and time-varying data. \n\
