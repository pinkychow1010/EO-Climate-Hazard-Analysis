// Planned features for data dashboard

/*

This page is solely a board to describe furture development plan, 
including to do list.

(planned)
- add a reset button to map for switching between analysis tasks, 
at the moment user needs to manually reload the page to perform another task

- build a template for external settings using location selection tool, 
at the moment user can perform tasks with location but external control, 
eg. slider for threshold picked, is not possible. This can be solved with 
additional widgets with the changes of Map.clear() to automated map layer removal

- convert Map.clear() to remove layers. At the moment after user select location,
all map widget will be removed along with map layers, hinder the funcationality of 
external widgets

- convert app interface to split panel. At the moment the app interface is designed to 
show location selection at the top, with results displaying at the bottom. 
The limited space causes inconvenience for displaying further information,
as the content of the side panel will become very long and user have to schroll
down a lot. 

An alternative can be a horizontal split panel, where the 
location selection and results are displayed in the left, and analysis documentation
is displayed in the right. Default should be showing left panel only.
User can check the right panel for information such as: how the indices are calculated?
what data sources are used? and so on.

- documentation for different analysis tasks

(completed)
