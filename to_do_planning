// Planned features for intraurban analysis data dashboard
// The toolbox includes data downloader and data analysis tool
// Furture features are listed here.

/*

This page is solely a board to describe furture development plan, 
including to do list.

(known bugs)

(fixed bugs)

- <del> For data downloader, land use download resampled to another resolution do not retain original class (expected same class from majority interpolation) </del>

- <del> After downloaded, when data layer changed, raster download link does not change accordingly </del>

(planned)

- add relative wealth index to downloader

- national zonal statistics with adm 2 polygons (building an interface)

- area of agricultural lands (downloader)

- area of built-up (downloader)

- historical heatwave events / agricultural stress

- add cloud masking steps for MODIS LST analysis 

- NDVI - LST comparison

- include Oxford/MAP/friction_surface_2019 into data downloader

- add a reset button to map for switching between analysis tasks, 
at the moment user needs to manually reload the page to perform another task

- build a template for external settings using location selection tool, 
at the moment user can perform tasks with location but external control, 
eg. slider for threshold picked, is not possible. This can be solved with 
additional widgets with the changes of Map.clear() to automated map layer removal

- convert Map.clear() to remove layers. At the moment after user select location,
all map widget will be removed along with map layers, hinder the funcationality of 
external widgets

- convert app interface to split panel. At the moment the app interface is designed to 
show location selection at the top, with results displaying at the bottom. 
The limited space causes inconvenience for displaying further information,
as the content of the side panel will become very long and user have to schroll
down a lot. 

An alternative can be a horizontal split panel, where the 
location selection and results are displayed in the left, and analysis documentation
is displayed in the right. Default should be showing left panel only.
User can check the right panel for information such as: how the indices are calculated?
what data sources are used? and so on.

- documentation for different analysis tasks (in progress)

- Future: air pollution S5, flooding S1 ...

(completed)

- <del> display default resolution for data layers </del>

- <del> Welcome panel for instruction and documentation download. </del>

- <del> Heat Wave Magnitude Index daily: is defined as the maximum magnitude of the heat waves in a year, where heat wave is the period ≥ 3 consecutive days with maximum temperature above the daily threshold for the reference period 1981–2010. The threshold is defined as the 90th percentile of daily maxima, centered on a 31 day window. </del>

- <del> WorldPop age distribution / gender </del>

- <del> use ERA5/TerraClimate threshold to calculate heatwave frequency </del>
