Data analysis and explorer dashboards are created to facilitate remote-sensing-based analysis using cloud computing power from Google Earth Engine. The dashboards allow users to easily download analysis-ready data layers, such as urban heat intensity and urbanisation trends within political-administrative boundaries worldwide. Users can download the results in CSV or GeoTIFF format for further GIS analysis.

**Current analysis tasks include:**

* **Zonal statistics of land surface temperature**

How is urban heat spatially distributed? Which neighborhood has more intense UHI effects?

* **Land surface temperature time series for vegetation change hotspots**

Are there relationship between urban heat and changes of urban green?

* **Age Risk Factor**

Senior population suffers more from heat waves. What are the risk factor for different cities and neighborhoods?

* **Land Cover Ratio**

How do different land cover type spatially distributed? What are the most dominent land uses?

* **Population / Urban Density**

Where do the majority of the population live in the city?
