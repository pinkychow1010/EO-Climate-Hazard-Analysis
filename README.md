Data analysis and explorer dashboards are created to facilitate remote-sensing-based analysis using cloud computing power from Google Earth Engine. The dashboards allow users to easily download analysis-ready data layers, such as urban heat intensity and urbanisation trends within political-administrative boundaries worldwide. Users can download the results in CSV or GeoTIFF format for further GIS analysis.
